description: "Afloat and Ashore is a nautical fiction novel by James Fenimore Cooper\
  \ first published in 1844. Set in 1796-1804, the novel follows the maritime adventures\
  \ of Miles Wallingford Jr. , the son of wealthy New York landowners who chooses\
  \ to go to sea after the death of his parents. The novel ends abruptly part way\
  \ through, and is followed by what critic Harold D. Langely called a \"necessary\"\
  \ sequel Miles Wallingford, which resolves many thematic and plot elements. The\
  \ novel is partially autobiographical, in part by Cooper's own experiences as a\
  \ sailor, and is his first full-length novel to fully employ a first-person narrative.\n\
